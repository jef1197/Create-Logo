# Create Logo

## Description

This is the Module 10 Challenge for the boot camp. The code was made from scratch to allow the user to quickly create a basic logo. The user will be given a series of promts that they will need to answer. Promts will ask for the text and color for the desired logo aswell as the desired shape (circle, square, triangle). Once all prompts have been answerd the logo will be created as a SVG file found in the output folder.
